This project explores how well a machine learning approach is suited to identifying cell types from RNA-seq data, as compared to dimensionality reduction and clustering. Notably, RNA-seq data comes with many features compared to the number of data points and suffers from high noise and sparse data. Nonetheless, a simple neural network trained on a subset of features performs better than dimensionality reduction and subsequent clustering.
