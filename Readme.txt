This project explores how well a machine learning approach is suited to identifying cell types from RNA-seq data, as compared to dimensionality reduction and clustering. Notably, RNA-seq data comes with many features compared to the number of data points and suffers from high noise and sparse data. Nonetheless, a simple neural network trained on a subset of features performs better than dimensionality reduction and subsequent clustering.

The running of the code demands loading the data set melanoma_raw_data.csv, which can be found in the repository https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/scRNA-seq_Datasets/7174922. The data was first published by Itay Tirosh et al. , Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq.Science352,189-196(2016).DOI:10.1126/science.aad0501.
